ORID Practice:

Objective (O) [What did we learn today? What activities did you do? what scenes have impressed you?]

We learn about how to do refactor in today leassons, including identify code smell and the corresponding correct method like rename, extract method etc. The scenes that
our group draw the concept map together have impressed me.

Relection: Challenging(as today refactor part kinda teach too fast)

Interpretive: Have a breify understanding about the refactor concept and how to use IDE shortcut

Decisional: I will try to adopt refactor and shortcut in my future work, and do baby commit with meaningful commit message.
